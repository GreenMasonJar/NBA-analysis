Analysis of NBA teams

Welcome to my NBA Analyses program!

The function of this program is really quite simple. This will will take multiple csv files of NBA stats, from whatever years you want/can find, and creates 2 new readable csv files.

The first is NEW.csv, this file now holds the average of each stat you disignated in the 'header' value for the last x years (x being how many years you added)

The second is WINNERS.csv, which shows the winner of each stat (according to the averages on NEW.csv)
